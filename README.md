# Optimizing-Agricultural-Production
The Optimizing Agricultural Production is a cutting-edge solution aimed at enhancing crop yield and productivity by leveraging data-driven insights.Through the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, this project helps farmers make informed decisions on various aspects of agriculture such as sowing time, irrigation, fertilization and pest control.

Steps to do:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Preparing the data for model building.

2. Performed Clustering analysis using KMeans algorithm. Building Liner Regression model.
